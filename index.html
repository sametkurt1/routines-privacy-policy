    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Routines</strong> values user privacy.</p>

    <p>
        This application does not collect, store, or directly share users' personal data with third parties. 
        The application does not require any account creation or server connection to perform its core functions.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The application does not collect personal data.</li>
        <li>There is no account creation or login system.</li>
        <li>No data is transmitted to the application developer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All data within the application is stored only on the user's own device (locally).</li>
        <li>This data cannot be accessed by the application developer.</li>
        <li>When the application is deleted, all data stored on the device is also deleted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third Parties and Advertisements</h2>
    <p>
        The application may display <strong>rewarded ads (watch ads)</strong> to support the developer, 
        subject to the user's request.
    </p>

    <p>
        These advertisements are provided by third-party ad providers (e.g., Google AdMob). 
        Viewing advertisements is entirely optional and is not mandatory for the core functions of the application.
    </p>

    <p>
        The application developer does not collect or store any personal data through these advertisements. 
        However, ad providers may process limited device information (e.g., Advertising ID) 
        within the scope of their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The application does not target children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect data from this age group. 
        Advertisements are only displayed with the user's explicit consent.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. 
        Any changes made will be published on this page.
